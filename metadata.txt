about=WTSS is a lightweight web service for handling time series data from remote sensing imagery. Given a location and a time interval you can retrieve the according time series as a JSON array of numbers. In WTSS a coverage is a three dimensional array associate to spatial and temporal reference systems. This implementation relies on the SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog specification. All the the coverages provided by the service are queried in STAC catalogs. Then the GDAL library is used to extract the time series for the specified location.
