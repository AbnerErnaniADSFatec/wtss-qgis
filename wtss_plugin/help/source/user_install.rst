Follow the installation guide to configure python dependencies, note that you can choose (using the checkbox to enable the use of Python Home) install dependencies directly in ``Python Home`` (not recommended) or localy using the ``Plugin Path``.

The users can choose install dependencies ``all in one time`` (Install All) or ``one by one`` (Install By), the last option is recommended when the user has any of plugin dependencies `setup.py <https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/wtss-qgis/blob/8767a8ae6e29ad5c115ac8f8d66b7034f857c6c3/setup.py#L60>`_ already installed in your environment.

This window will run the ``pip install`` command using a subprocess. After this step, this window will request the user to reload the QGIS instance.

After reload the QGIS environment go to ``Plugins >> Manage and Install Plugins`` and enable the ``WTSS``.
